# Obtaining Raw Airfoil Data

<p align="justify">
  
  The raw airfoil data was obtained from the [UIUC Airfoil Data](https://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/coord_database.html) and the [Airfoil Tools](http://www.airfoiltools.com/) websites. The data from the UIUC site was obtained using a Python script (scraper.py) developed by [JoshTheEngineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nILo18DlqAo), and the Airfoil Tools data was manually downloaded.
