# Processed Airfoil Data

This folder contains the 600-point .dat files and the CST coefficients of the airfoils obtained from the UIUC and Airfoiltools sites. These were obtained using the MATLAB-based CST framework. Further, the airfoils thus obtained have been plotted against the original airfoil. A very high degree of accuracy has been achieved.
