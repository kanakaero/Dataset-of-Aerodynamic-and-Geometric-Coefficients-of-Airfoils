# Baseline Model

A feed-forward neural network architecture was implemented. This network consists of 2 layers, with 12 and 6 neurons, respectively. Batch Normalization and ReLU activation functions were applied after each layer. The network was trained to predict the lift and drag coefficients of an airfoil based on its 8 CST coefficients and an angle of attack as input.
