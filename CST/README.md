# Class Shape Transformation Framework
<p align="justify">

  A Class Shape Transformation routine was developed using MATLAB<sup>®️</sup> based on the work of [Brenda Kulfan](https://www.brendakulfan.com/), titled, [A Universal Parametric Geometry
  Representation Method - "CST"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245430684_Universal_Parametric_Geometry_Representation_Method). The framework was developed on the work done by 
[Pramudita Satria Palar](https://pramsatriapalar.wordpress.com/2013/06/15/short-note-on-cst-method-for-airfoil-parameterization-matlab-code-included/).

The airfoils are parametrized into eight CST coefficients using shape and class functions. These eight CST coefficients are given by,

The 600-point .dat files of the airfoils and their eight coefficients outputted by this framework are stored in the processed airfoil data directory of this repository.
