# Put the '.dat' Files and their Coefficients Here

The '.dat' files and their corresponding CST coefficient files are to be stored in this directory. The number of airfoils to be stored would depend on the number of parallel processes to be run. For example, if 60 simulations are to be run in parallel, there would be roughly 50 airfoils stored here (assuming that the total number of airfoils is 3000).
